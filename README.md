# Sorting

## Due: Fri 3/31 at 11:59 PM

### No Googling any of the sorting algorithms

- Create a program called `Sorting.java`
- Create a void static method that implents the bubble sort algorithm
- Create a void static method that implents the selection sort algorithm
- Create a void static method that implents the insertion sort algorithm
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in for bubble sort
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in for selection sort
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in for insertion sort
  - Read from each file
  - The first line in each file is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines of each file into three separate arrays
  - Use each sorting method you wrote to sort the corresponding array
  - Print each sorted array

***Example Input:***\
input1.txt\
input2.txt\
input3.txt\
***Example Output:***\
Bubble sort: 1, 2, 3, 7, 17, 19, 24, 30, 44, 85\
Selection sort: -42, -17, -8, 2, 10, 19, 53, 77\
Insertion sort: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
