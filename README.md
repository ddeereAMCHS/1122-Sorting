# Sorting

- Create a program called `Sorting.java`
- Create a void static method that implents the selection sort algorithm
- Create a void static method that implents the insertion sort algorithm
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user to enter a filename containing the data to read in
  - Read from that file
  - The first line is the number of elements the file contains
  - Read the remaining lines into an array
  - Make a copy of that array
  - Use the selection sort method you wrote to sort the array
  - Print the sorted array
  - Use the insertion sort method you wrote to sort the copy of the array
    - Make sure you don't try to sort the already sorted array
  - Print the sorted array
